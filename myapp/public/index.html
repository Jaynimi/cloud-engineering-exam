        <p class="mt-4 text-xl">
           AgroTech is an innovative waste-solving platform that connects farmers directly to consumers, reducing agricultural waste and improving food distribution efficiency.

Powered by cloud engineering services, AgroTech leverages scalable infrastructure, real-time data processing, and secure cloud storage to optimize the supply chain, enable seamless transactions, and ensure transparent, data-driven operations from farm to table.

            As a Senior Cloud Engineer at AgroTech, I led the design, deployment, and optimization of the cloud infrastructure powering our farm-to-consumer platform.

I architected scalable, secure, and resilient cloud solutions to support real-time data exchange, user transactions, and supply chain logistics.

            I'm a Cloud Engineering student in the School of Engineering at
            AltSchool Africa. My goal for the program is to design and deliver cloud solutions that empower platforms like AgroTech to operate more efficiently across Nigeria, Africa, and the global market. By leveraging cloud infrastructure, I aim to reduce redundancies, improve data-driven decision-making, and support scalable, secure systems that connect farmers to consumers, reduce waste, and strengthen food distribution networks.
